Regular Expression Compiler and String Search

This assignment implements a regex compiler, and uses the compiled
output to perform a global search of the input (meaning multiple
matches are possible).

The regex compiler will accept an expression and output a file
containing a finite state machine.

The string search will accept a finite state machine and an input file
and output all the lines where the regexp is matched.
